Omkvæd
And it&amp;rsquo;s all for me grog
Me jolly, jolly grog
All for my beer and tobacco
Well, I spent all me tin
With the ladies drinkin&amp;rsquo; gin
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander
1.
I&amp;rsquo;m sick in the head
And I haven&amp;rsquo;t been to bed
Since first I came ashore with me plunder
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen centipedes and snakes</description>

      <description>1.
In a neat little town they called Belfast
Apprentice to trade I was bound
And many an hour sweet happiness
I spent in that neat little town
&amp;lsquo;Til bad misfortune came o&amp;rsquo;er me
That caused me to stray from the land
Far away from me friends and relations
To follow the black velvet band
Omkvæd
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds
You&amp;rsquo;d think she was queen of the land</description>

When I was young and in my prime
and could wander wild and free
There was always a longing in my mind
to follow the call of the sea
Omkvæd
So I&amp;rsquo;ll sing farewell to Carlingford
and farewell to Grenore
and I&amp;rsquo;ll think of you both day and night
until I return once more
until I return once more

I took a stroll on the old long walk
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk
Of a fine soft day -I-ay
Omkvæd x 2
And I ask you, friend, what&amp;rsquo;s a fella to do
&amp;lsquo;Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue</description>

Bro
I&amp;rsquo;ll tell me Ma when I go home,
The boy&amp;rsquo;s won&amp;rsquo;t leave the girls alone.
They&amp;rsquo;ll pull my hair, they stole my comb,
Well that&amp;rsquo;s alright till I go home.

She is handsome. She is pretty.
She is the bell of Dublin City.
She is courtin&amp;rsquo; one, two, three.
Please won&amp;rsquo;t you tell me, who is she?

Albert Mooney say&amp;rsquo;s he loves her.</description>

In Dublin&amp;rsquo;s fair city,
Where the girls are so pretty,
I first set me eyes on sweet Molly Malone,
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow,
Through streets broad and narrow,
Crying, &amp;ldquo;Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!&amp;rdquo;
Omkvæd
Alive, alive, oh,
Alive, alive, oh,
Crying &amp;ldquo;cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh&amp;rdquo;

As I went home on Monday night as drunk as drunk could be
I saw a horse outside the door where my old horse should be
Well, I called me wife and said to her: Will you kindly tell to me
Who owns that horse outside the door where my old horse should be?
Omkvæd
Ah, you&amp;rsquo;re drunk,
you&amp;rsquo;re drunk you silly old fool,
still you can not see</description>

In Banbridge Town in the County Down
One morning last July
From a bóithrín [boreen] green came a sweet cailín [colleen]
And she smiled as she passed me by
She looked so sweet fronn her two bare feet
To the sheen of her nut brown hair
Such a winsome elf, sure I shook myself
For to see I was really there

By a lonely prison wall,
I heard a young girl calling
Michael, they have taken you away,
For you stole Trevelyan&amp;rsquo;s corn,
So the young might see the morn.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay
Omkvæd
Low lie the fields of Athenry
Where once we watched the small free birds fly
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing</description>

In my memory I will always see
The town that I have loved so well
Where the school played ball by the gasyard wall
And we laughed through the smoke and the smell
Going home in the rain running up the dark lane
Past the jail and down behind the fountain
Those were happy days in so many, many ways
In the town I loved so well

I&amp;rsquo;ve been a wild rover for many&amp;rsquo;s a year,
And I&amp;rsquo;ve spent all my money on whiskey and beer
And now I&amp;rsquo;m returning with gold in great store,
And I never will play the wild rover no more
Omkvæd
And it&amp;rsquo;s no, nay, never
No, nay, never, no more
Will I play the wild rover
No, never, no more

As I was a goin&amp;rsquo; over the far famed Kerry mountains
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I first produced me pistol and then produced me rapier
Saying &amp;ldquo;Stand and deliver&amp;rdquo; for he were a foul deceiver
Omkvæd
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da
Whack for my daddy-o.
Whack for my daddy-o
There&amp;rsquo;s whiskey in the jar

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny</description>

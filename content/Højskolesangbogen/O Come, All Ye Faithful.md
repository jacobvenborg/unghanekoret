1\.\
O come, all ye faithful,\
Joyful and triumphant,\
O come ye, O come ye, to Bethlehem\
Come and behold Him\
Born the King of Angels:\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*Christ the Lord!*

2\.\
God of God,\
Light of Light\
Lo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb,\
Very God,\
Begotten, not created:\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*Christ the Lord!*

3\.\
Sing, choirs of angels,\
Sing in exultation,\
Sing, all ye citizens of heaven above,\
Glory to God\
In the highest:\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*Christ the Lord!*

4\.\
O, Yea, Lord we greet thee,\
Born this happy morning,\
Jesu, to thee be glory given\
Word of the father,\
Now in flesh appearing:\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*O come, let us adore Him*\
*Christ the Lord!*

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls came tumbling down

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls came tumbling down

1\.\
Good morning sister Mary\
Good morning brother John\
Well I wanna stop and talk with you\
Wanna tell you how I come along

2\.\
I know you've heard about Joshua\
He was the son of Nun\
He never stopped his work until\
Until the work was done

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls come tumbling down

3\.\
You may talk about your men of Gideon\
You may brag about your men of Saul\
There's none like good old Joshua\
At the battle of Jericho

4\.\
Up to the walls of Jericho\
He marched with spear in hand\
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried\
'Cause the battle is in my hands

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls come tumbling down

5\.\
You may talk about your men of Gideon\
You may brag about your king of Saul\
There none like Joshua\
At the battle of Jericho

6\.\
They tell me, great God that Joshua's spear\
Was well nigh twelve feet long\
And upon his hip was a double edged sword\
And his mouth was a gospel horn

7\.\
Yet bold and brave he stood\
Salvation in his hand\
Go blow them ram horns Joshua cried\
'Cause the devil can't do you no harm

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls come tumbling down

8\.\
Up to the walls of Jericho\
He marched with spear in hand\
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried\
'Cause the battle is in my hands

9\.\
Then the lamb ram sheep horns began to blow\
The trumpets began to sound\
Old Joshua shouted glory\
And the walls came tumblin' down

*Omkvæd*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls come tumbling down

*Outro*\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
Jericho Jericho\
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho\
And the walls come tumbling\
The walls come tumbling\
The walls come tumbling down\

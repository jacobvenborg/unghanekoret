Good morning sister Mary<br>
Good morning brother John<br>
Well I wanna stop and talk with you<br>
Wanna tell you how I come along<br>

I know you've heard about Joshua<br>
He was the son of Nun<br>
He never stopped his work until<br>
Until the work was done<br>

3\.\
You may talk about your men of Gideon<br>
You may brag about your men of Saul<br>
There's none like good old Joshua<br>
At the battle of Jericho<br>

4\.\
Up to the walls of Jericho<br>
He marched with spear in hand<br>
Go blow them ram horns, Joshua cried<br>
'Cause the battle is in my hands<br>

They tell me, great God that Joshua's spear<br>
Was well nigh twelve feet long<br>
And upon his hip was a double edged sword<br>
And his mouth was a gospel horn<br>

7\.\
Yet bold and brave he stood<br>
Salvation in his hand<br>
Go blow them ram horns Joshua cried<br>
'Cause the devil can't do you no harm<br>

The trumpets began to sound<br>
Old Joshua shouted glory<br>
And the walls came tumblin' down<br>

*Omkvæd*\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home

1\.\
I looked over Jordan, and what did I see\
Comin' for to carry me home\
A band of angels comin' after me\
Comin' for to carry me home

*Omkvæd*\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home

2\.\
If you get there before I do\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Tell al my friends that I'm a comin' too\
Comin' for to carry me home

*Omkvæd*\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home

3\.\
I'm sometimes up and sometimes down\
Comin' for to carry me home\
But still my soul feels heavenly bound\
Comin' for to carry me home

*Omkvæd*\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home

*Omkvæd*\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home\
Swing low, sweet chariot\
Comin' for to carry me home

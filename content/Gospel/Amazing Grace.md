1\.\
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound\
That saved a wretch like me.\
I once was lost, but now am found,\
Was blind, but now I see.

2\.\
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,\
And grace my fears relieved.\
How precious did that grace appear\
The hour I first believed.

3\.\
When we've been there ten thousand years\
Bright shining as the sun,\
We've no less days to sing God's praise\
Than when we've first begun.

4\.\
Shall I be wafted to the skies,\
on flow'ry beds of ease.\
While others strive to win the prize,\
And sail the bloody seas.

*Through many dangers, toils and snares\
I have already come;\
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far\
And grace will lead me home.\*

*The Lord has promised good to me\
His word my hope secures;\
He will my shield and portion be,\
As long as life endures.\*

*Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\
And mortal life shall cease,\
I shall possess within the veil,\
A life of joy and peace.*

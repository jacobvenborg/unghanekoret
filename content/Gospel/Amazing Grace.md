1\.\
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound<br>
That saved a wretch like me.<br>
I once was lost, but now am found,<br>
Was blind, but now I see.<br>

2\.\
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
And grace my fears relieved.<br>
How precious did that grace appear<br>
The hour I first believed.<br>

3\.\
When we've been there ten thousand years<br>
Bright shining as the sun,<br>
We've no less days to sing God's praise<br>
Than when we've first begun.<br>

4\.\
Shall I be wafted to the skies,<br>
on flow'ry beds of ease.<br>
While others strive to win the prize,<br>
And sail the bloody seas.<br>

*Through many dangers, toils and snares<br>
I have already come;<br>
'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far<br>
And grace will lead me home.<br>*

*The Lord has promised good to me<br>
His word my hope secures;<br>
He will my shield and portion be,<br>
As long as life endures.<br>*

*Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,<br>
And mortal life shall cease,<br>
I shall possess within the veil,<br>
A life of joy and peace.*

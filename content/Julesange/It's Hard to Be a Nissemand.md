Work work and work the hiele daw.\
Work work and work there's nok to lawe.\
No food, no hvil, no noget som helst\
I think it is a little trælst.

Yeah it's hard to be a nissemand\
Yeah it's hard to be a nisse.

No'en can have free when it is jul.\
Free båd' from arbejd' and from school.\
But when you are a nissemand\
that's simpelthen not noget you can.

Yeah it's hard to be a nissemand\
Yeah it's hard to be a nisse.

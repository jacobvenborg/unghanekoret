*A-stykke*\
Imagine me and you, I do\
I think about you day and night\
It's only right\
To think about the girl you love\
And hold her tight\
So happy together

*A-stykke*\
If I should call you up, invest a dime\
And you say you belong to me\
And ease my mind\
Imagine how the world could be\
So very fine\
So happy together

*B-stykke*\
I can't see me loving nobody but you for all my life\
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

*A-stykke*\
Me and you and you and me\
No matter how they tossed the dice\
It had to be\
The only one for me is you\
And you for me\
So happy together

*B-stykke*\
I can't see me loving nobody but you for all my life\
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life

*A-stykke*\
Me and you and you and me\
No matter how they tossed the dice\
It had to be\
The only one for me is you\
And you for me\
So happy together

*Instrumentelt B-stykke*

*A-stykke*\
Me and you and you and me\
No matter how they tossed the dice\
It had to be\
The only one for me is you\
And you for me\
So happy together

So happy together\
How is the weather?

So happy together\
We're happy together

So happy together\
We're happy together

So happy together\
So happy together

*Noter: 3-stemmigt hele sangen fraset f√∏rste del af B-stykke*

A-stykke\
There's a world where I can go\
And tell my secrets to
In my room\
In my room (In my room)

A-stykke\
In this world I lock out\
All my worries and my fears
In my room\
In my room (In my room)

B-stykke\
Do my dreaming and my scheming\
Lie awake and pray\
Do my crying and my sighing\
Laugh at yesterday

A-stykke\
Now it's dark and I'm alone\
But I won't be afraid
In my room\
In my room (In my room, in my room)

In my room (In my room, in my room)

Doe, a deer, a female deer\
Ray, a drop of golden sun\
Me, a name I call myself\
Far, a long, long way to run\
Sow, a needle pulling thread\
La, a note to follow so\
Tea, I drink with jam and bread\
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh

Do, a deer, a female deer\
Re, a drop of golden sun\
Mi, a name I call myself\
Fa, a long, long way to run\
So, a needle pulling thread\
La, a note to follow so\
Ti, I drink with jam and bread\
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh

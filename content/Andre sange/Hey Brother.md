Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover<br>
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker<br>
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you<br>
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do<br>

Hey, brother, do you still believe in one another?<br>
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?<br>
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you<br>
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do<br>

Omkvæd<br>
What if I'm far from home?<br>
Oh, brother, I will hear you call<br>
What if I lose it all?<br>
Oh, sister, I will help you out!<br>
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you<br>
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do<br>

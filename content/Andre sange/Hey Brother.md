Hey, brother, there's an endless road to re-discover\
Hey, sister, know the water's sweet but blood is thicker\
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you\
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Hey, brother, do you still believe in one another?\
Hey, sister, do you still believe in love, I wonder?\
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you\
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

Omkvæd\
What if I'm far from home?\
Oh, brother, I will hear you call\
What if I lose it all?\
Oh, sister, I will help you out!\
Oh, if the sky comes falling down for you\
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do

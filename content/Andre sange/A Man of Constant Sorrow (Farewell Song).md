*In constant sorrow through all his days*

I am a ma-an of constant sorrow\
I've seen trouble all my day\
I bid farewe-ell to old Kentucky\
The place where I was born and raised\
*The place where he-e was born and raised*

For six long ye-ears I've been in trouble\
No pleasures here on earth I found\
For in this wo-orld I'm bound to ramble\
I have no friends to help me now\
*He has no frie-ends to help him now*

It's fare thee we-ell my old true lover\
I never expect to see you again\
For I'm bound to ri-ide that northern railroad\
Perhaps I'll die upon this train\
*Perhaps he'll di-ie upon this train*

You can bury me -in some deep valley\
For many years where I may lay\
Then you may le-earn to love another\
While I am sleeping in my grave\
*While he is slee-eeping in his grave*

Maybe your friends thi-ink I'm just a stranger\
My face, you'll never will see no more\
But there is one pro-omise that is given\
I'll meet you on God's golden shore\
*He'll meet you o-on God's golden shore*

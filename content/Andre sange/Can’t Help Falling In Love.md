Wise men say\
Only fools rush in\
But I can't help falling in love with you\
Shall I stay?\
Would it be a sin\
If I can't help falling in love with you?\

Like a river flows\
Surely to the sea\
Darling, so it goes\
Some things are meant to be\

Take my hand,\
Take my whole life, too\
For I can't help falling in love with you\

Like a river flows\
Surely to the sea\
Darling, so it goes\
Some things are meant to be\

Take my hand,\
Take my whole life, too\
For I can't help falling in love with you\
For I can't help falling in love with you\

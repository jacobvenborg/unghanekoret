1\.\
By a lonely prison wall,\
I heard a young girl calling\
Michael, they have taken you away,\
For you stole Trevelyan's corn,\
So the young might see the morn.\
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay

Omkvæd\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

2\.\
By a lonely prison wall,\
I heard a young man calling\
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free\
Against the famine and the Crown,\
I rebelled, they put me down.\
Now you must raise our child with dignity

Omkvæd\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

3\.\
By a lonely harbor wall,\
She watched the last star falling\
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky\
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray,\
For her love in Botany Bay\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

Omkvæd\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

Omkvæd *(her kommer overstemmen på)*\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

Omkvæd *(a capella)*\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry

Omkvæd\
Low lie the fields of Athenry\
Where once we watched the small free birds fly\
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing\
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry\

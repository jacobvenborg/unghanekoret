1.<br>
By a lonely prison wall,<br>
I heard a young girl calling<br>
Michael, they have taken you away,<br>
For you stole Trevelyan's corn,<br>
So the young might see the morn.<br>
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

2.<br>
By a lonely prison wall,<br>
I heard a young man calling<br>
Nothing matters, Mary, when you're free<br>
Against the famine and the Crown,<br>
I rebelled, they put me down.<br>
Now you must raise our child with dignity<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

3.<br>
By a lonely harbor wall,<br>
She watched the last star falling<br>
As that prison ship sailed out against the sky<br>
Sure she'll wait and hope and pray,<br>
For her love in Botany Bay<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

Omkvæd *(her kommer overstemmen på)*<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

Omkvæd *(a capella)*<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Low lie the fields of Athenry<br>
Where once we watched the small free birds fly<br>
Our love was on the wing, we had dreams and songs to sing<br>
It's so lonely 'round the fields of Athenry<br>

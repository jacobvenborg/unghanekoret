1\.\
As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains\
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting\
I first produced me pistol and then produced me rapier\
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a foul deceiver

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar

2\.\
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny\
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny\
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me\
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar

3\.\
I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber\
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder\
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water\
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar

4\.\
'Twas early in the morning, just before I rose to travel\
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell\
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier\
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar

5\.\
Now some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'\
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling\
but I take delight in the juice of the barley\
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar

If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army\
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney\
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny\
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny

Omkvæd\
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da\
Whack for my daddy-o.\
Whack for my daddy-o\
There's whiskey in the jar\

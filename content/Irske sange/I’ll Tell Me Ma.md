Bro<br>
I'll tell me Ma when I go home,<br>
The boy's won't leave the girls alone.<br>
They'll pull my hair, they stole my comb,<br>
Well that's alright till I go home.<br>

Omkvæd<br>
She is handsome. She is pretty.<br>
She is the bell of Dublin City.<br>
She is courtin' one, two, three.<br>
Please won't you tell me, who is she?<br>

1.<br>
Albert Mooney say's he loves her.<br>
All the boy's are fighting for her.<br>
They knock at the door and ring at the bell<br>
Sayin' "Oh my true love, are you well"?<br>
Out she comes as white as snow,<br>
Rings on her fingers and bells on her toes<br>
Ole Jenny Murray says she'll die<br>
If you don't get the fella With the roving eye<br>

Bro<br>
I'll tell me Ma when I go home,<br>
The boy's won't leave the girls alone.<br>
They'll pull my hair, they stole my comb,<br>
Well that's alright till I go home.<br>

Omkvæd<br>
She is handsome. She is pretty.<br>
She is the bell of Dublin City.<br>

Please won't you tell me, who is she?<br>

2.<br>
Let the wind and the rain and hail blow high<br>
And the snow come tumbling from the sky,<br>
She's as nice as apple pie.<br>
She'll get her own lad by and by.<br>
When she gets a lad of her own,<br>
She won't tell her Ma when she gets home.<br>
Let them all come as they will<br>
For it's Albert Mooney she loves still.<br>

Bro<br>

Well that's alright till I go home.<br>

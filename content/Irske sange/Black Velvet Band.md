In a neat little town they called Belfast\
Apprentice to trade I was bound\
And many an hour sweet happiness\
I spent in that neat little town\
'Til bad misfortune came o'er me\
That caused me to stray from the land\
Far away from me friends and relations\
To follow the black velvet band

*Omkvæd*\
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds\
You'd think she was queen of the land\
And her hair hung over her shoulders\
Tied up with a black velvet band

Well I went out strolling one evening\
Not meaning to go very far\
When I met with a ficklesome damsel\
She was sellin' her trade in the bar\
When a watch she took from a pocket\
And slipped it right into me hand\
Then the law came and put me in prison\
Bad luck to her black velvet band

*Omkvæd*\
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds\
You'd think she was queen of the land\
And her hair hung over her shoulders\
Tied up with a black velvet band

Next morning before judge and jury\
For trial I had to appear\
Then the judge he says me young fellow\
The case against you is quite clear\
And seven long years is your sentence\
You're goin' to Van Dieman's land\
Far away from your friends and relations\
To follow the black velvet band

*Omkvæd*\
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds\
You'd think she was queen of the land\
And her hair hung over her shoulders\
Tied up with a black velvet band

So come all ye jolly young fellows\
I'll have yous take warnin' by me\
And when ever you're out on the liquor, me lads\
Beware of the pretty colleens\
For they'll fill you with whisky and porter\
'Til you are not able to stand\
And the very next thing that you know, me lads\
You've landed in Van Dieman's land

Omkvæd x2\
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds\
You'd think she was queen of the land\
And her hair hung over her shoulders\
Tied up with a black velvet band

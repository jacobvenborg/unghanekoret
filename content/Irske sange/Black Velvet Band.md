In a neat little town they called Belfast<br>
Apprentice to trade I was bound<br>
And many an hour sweet happiness<br>
I spent in that neat little town<br>
'Til bad misfortune came o'er me<br>
That caused me to stray from the land<br>
Far away from me friends and relations<br>
To follow the black velvet band<br>
Omkvæd<br>
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds<br>
You'd think she was queen of the land<br>
And her hair hung over her shoulders<br>
Tied up with a black velvet band<br>

Well I went out strolling one evening<br>
Not meaning to go very far<br>
When I met with a ficklesome damsel<br>
She was sellin' her trade in the bar<br>
When a watch she took from a pocket<br>
And slipped it right into me hand<br>
Then the law came and put me in prison<br>
Bad luck to her black velvet band<br>
Omkvæd<br>
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds<br>
You'd think she was queen of the land<br>
And her hair hung over her shoulders<br>
Tied up with a black velvet band<br>

Next morning before judge and jury<br>
For trial I had to appear<br>
Then the judge he says me young fellow<br>
The case against you is quite clear<br>
And seven long years is your sentence<br>
You're goin' to Van Dieman's land<br>
Far away from your friends and relations<br>
To follow the black velvet band<br>
Omkvæd<br>
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds<br>
You'd think she was queen of the land<br>
And her hair hung over her shoulders<br>
Tied up with a black velvet band<br>

So come all ye jolly young fellows<br>
I'll have yous take warnin' by me<br>
And when ever you're out on the liquor, me lads<br>
Beware of the pretty colleens<br>
For they'll fill you with whisky and porter<br>
'Til you are not able to stand<br>
And the very next thing that you know, me lads<br>
You've landed in Van Dieman's land<br>
Omkvæd x2<br>
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds<br>
You'd think she was queen of the land<br>
And her hair hung over her shoulders<br>
Tied up with a black velvet band<br>

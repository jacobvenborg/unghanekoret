1.<br>
In Banbridge Town in the County Down<br>
One morning last July<br>
From a bóithrín [boreen] green came a sweet cailín [colleen]<br>
And she smiled as she passed me by<br>
She looked so sweet fronn her two bare feet<br>
To the sheen of her nut brown hair<br>
Such a winsome elf, sure I shook myself<br>
For to see I was really there<br>
Omkvæd<br>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and<br>
From Galway to Dublin Town<br>
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín<br>
That I met in the County Down<br>

2.<br>
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head<br>
And I looked with a feelin' rare<br>
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by<br>
"Whose the maid with the nut brown hair"?<br>
He smiled at me and he says's, say's he<br>
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown<br>
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann<br>
She's the star of the County Down"<br>
Omkvæd<br>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and<br>
From Galway to Dublin Town<br>
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín<br>
That I met in the County Down<br>

3.<br>
She'd soft brown eyes with a look so shy<br>
And a smile like a rose in June<br>
And she sang so sweet what a lovely treat<br>
As she lilted an Irish tune<br>
At the Lammas dance I was in the trance<br>
As she whirled with the lads of the town<br>
And it broke my heart just to be apart<br>
From the star of the County Down<br>
Omkvæd<br>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and<br>
From Galway to Dublin Town<br>
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín<br>
That I met in the County Down<br>

4.<br>
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there<br>
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes<br>
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right<br>
For a smile from my nut brown rose<br>
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke<br>
Till my plough tu-urns rust coloured brown<br>
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside<br>
Sits the star of the County Down<br>
Omkvæd<br>
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and<br>
From Galway to Dublin Town<br>
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín<br>
That I met in the County Down<br>

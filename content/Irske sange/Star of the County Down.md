1\.\
In Banbridge Town in the County Down\
One morning last July\
From a bóithrín [boreen] green came a sweet cailín [colleen]\
And she smiled as she passed me by\
She looked so sweet fronn her two bare feet\
To the sheen of her nut brown hair\
Such a winsome elf, sure I shook myself\
For to see I was really there

*Omkvæd*\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and\
From Galway to Dublin Town\
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín\
That I met in the County Down

2\.\
As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head\
And I looked with a feelin' rare\
And I say's, say's I, to a passer-by\
"Whose the maid with the nut brown hair"?\
He smiled at me and he says's, say's he\
"That's the gem of Ireland's crown\
It's Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann\
She's the star of the County Down"

*Omkvæd*\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and\
From Galway to Dublin Town\
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín\
That I met in the County Down

3\.\
She'd soft brown eyes with a look so shy\
And a smile like a rose in June\
And she sang so sweet what a lovely treat\
As she lilted an Irish tune\
At the Lammas dance I was in the trance\
As she whirled with the lads of the town\
And it broke my heart just to be apart\
From the star of the County Down

*Omkvæd*\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and\
From Galway to Dublin Town\
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín\
That I met in the County Down

4\.\
At the Harvest Fair she'll be surely there\
And I'll dress in my Sunday clothes\
With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked right\
For a smile from my nut brown rose\
No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke\
Till my plough tu-urns rust coloured brown\
Till a smiling bride, by my own fireside\
Sits the star of the County Down

*Omkvæd*\
From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay and\
From Galway to Dublin Town\
No maid I've seen like the brown cailín\
That I met in the County Down

1\.\
In Dublin's fair city,<br>
Where the girls are so pretty,<br>
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,<br>
As she wheeled her wheel-barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>

2\.\
She was a fishmonger,<br>
And sure 'twas no wonder,<br>
For so were her father and mother before,<br>
And they each wheeled their barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>
<br>

She died of a fever,<br>
And no one could save her,<br>
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.<br>
Now her ghost wheels her barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh!"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>
Omkvæd<br>

Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Alive, alive, oh,<br>
Crying "cockles and mussels, alive, alive, oh"<br>

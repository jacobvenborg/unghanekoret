*Noter: trestemmigt omkvæd*

***

1\.\
When I was young and in my prime\
and could wander wild and free\
There was always a longing in my mind\
to follow the call of the sea

*Omkvæd*\
So I'll sing farewell to Carlingford\
and farewell to Grenore\
and I'll think of you both day and night\
until I return once more\
until I return once more

2\.\
On all of the seven stormy seas\
I have sailed before the mast\
and on every voyage that I took\
I would swear t'would be me last!

*Omkvæd*\
So I'll sing farewell to Carlingford\
and farewell to Grenore\
and I'll think of you both day and night\
until I return once more\
until I return once more

3\.\
Now I had a girl called Mary Doyle\
and she lives in Grenore\
and the foremost thought within her mind\
was to keep me safe on shore

*Omkvæd*\
So I'll sing farewell to Carlingford\
and farewell to Grenore\
and I'll think of you both day and night\
until I return once more\
until I return once more

4\.\
Now the landman's life is all his own\
He can go, or he can stay\
But once the sea gets in his blood\
When she calls, he must obey!

*Omkvæd*\
So I'll sing farewell to Carlingford\
and farewell to Grenore\
and I'll think of you both day and night\
until I return once more\
until I return once more

Sidste *Omkvæd*\
Yes  I'll sing farewell to Carlingford\
and farewell to Grenore\
and I'll think of you both day and night\
until I return once more\
until I return once more

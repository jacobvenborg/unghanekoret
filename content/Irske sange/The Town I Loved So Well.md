1\.\
In my memory I will always see\
The town that I have loved so well\
Where the school played ball by the gasyard wall\
And we laughed through the smoke and the smell\
Going home in the rain running up the dark lane\
Past the jail and down behind the fountain\
Those were happy days in so many, many ways\
In the town I loved so well

2\.\
In the early morn' the shirt-factory horn\
Called women from Craigeen, the Moor and the Bog\
While the man on the dole played the mother's role\
Fed the children and then walked the dog\
And when times got tough there was just about enough\
But they saw it through without complaining\
For deep inside was a burning pride\
In the town I loved so well

3\.\
There was music there in the Derry air\
Like a language that we could all understand\
I remember the day when I earned my first pay\
And I played in a small pick-up band\
There I spent my youth, and to tell you the truth\
I was sad to leave it all behind me\
For I'd learned about life and I found me a wife\
In the town I loved so well

4\.\
But when I returned, how my eyes had burned\
To see how a town could be brought to it's knees\
With their armored cars and the bombed-out bars\
And the gas that hangs on to every breeze\
Now the army's installed by that old gasyard wall\
And the damned barbed wire gets higher and higher\
With their tanks and their guns, oh my god what have they done\
To the town I loved so well?

5\.\
Now the music's gone but they carry on\
For their spirit's been bruised, never broken\
They will not forget but their hearts are set\
On tomorrow and peace once again\
For what's done is done and what's won is won\
And what's lost is lost and gone forever\
I can only pray for a bright brand-new day\
In the town I loved so well\
For what's done is done and what's won is won\
And what's lost is lost and gone forever\
I can only pray for a bright brand-new day\
In the town I loved so well

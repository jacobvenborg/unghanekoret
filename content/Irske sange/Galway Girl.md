1\.\
I took a stroll on the old long walk\
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay\
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk\
Of a fine soft day -I-ay

Omkvæd\
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do\
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue\
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl\
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl

2\.\
We were halfway there when the rain came down\
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay\
And she asked me up to her flat downtown\
Of a fine soft day -I-ay

Omkvæd\
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do\
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue\
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl\
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl

3\.\
When I woke up I was all alone\
-- -- --\
With a broken heart and a ticket home\
-- -\- --

Omkvæd\
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do\
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue\
I've traveled around been all over this world\
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl\
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl

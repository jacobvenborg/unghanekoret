Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

1\.\
I'm sick in the head<br>
And I haven't been to bed<br>
Since first I came ashore with me plunder<br>
I've seen centipedes and snakes<br>
And me head is full of aches<br>
And I have to take a path for way out yonder<br>
Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

2\.\
Where are me boots<br>
Me noggin', noggin' boots<br>
They're all sold for beer and tobacco<br>
See the soles they were thin<br>
And the uppers were lettin' in<br>
And the heels were lookin' out for better weather<br>
Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

3\.\
Where is me shirt,<br>
Me noggin', noggin' shirt<br>
It's all sold for beer and tobacco<br>
You see the sleeves were all worn out<br>
And the collar been torn about<br>
And the tail was lookin' out for better weather<br>
Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

4\.\
Where is me wife,<br>
Me noggin', noggin' wife<br>
She's all sold for beer and tobacco<br>
You see her front it was worn out<br>
And her tail I kicked about<br>
And I'm sure she's lookin' out for better weather<br>
Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

5\.\
Where is me bed<br>
Me noggin', noggin' bed<br>
It's all sold for beer and tobacco<br>
You see I sold it to the girls<br>
Until the springs were all in twirls<br>
And the sheets they're lookin' out for better weather<br>
Omkvæd<br>
And it's all for me grog<br>
Me jolly, jolly grog<br>
All for my beer and tobacco<br>
Well, I spent all me tin<br>
With the ladies drinkin' gin<br>
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander<br>

Omkvæd\
And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

1\.\
I'm sick in the head\
And I haven't been to bed\
Since first I came ashore with me plunder\
I've seen centipedes and snakes\
And me head is full of aches\
And I have to take a path for way out yonder\

Omkvæd\
And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

2\.\
Where are me boots\
Me noggin', noggin' boots\
They're all sold for beer and tobacco\
See the soles they were thin\
And the uppers were lettin' in\
And the heels were lookin' out for better weather\

Omkvæd\
And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

3\.\
Where is me shirt,\
Me noggin', noggin' shirt\
It's all sold for beer and tobacco\
You see the sleeves were all worn out\
And the collar been torn about\
And the tail was lookin' out for better weather

Omkvæd\
And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

4\.\
Where is me wife,\
Me noggin', noggin' wife\
She's all sold for beer and tobacco\
You see her front it was worn out\
And her tail I kicked about\
And I'm sure she's lookin' out for better weather\

Omkvæd\
And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander

5\.\
Where is me bed\
Me noggin', noggin' bed\
It's all sold for beer and tobacco\
You see I sold it to the girls\
Until the springs were all in twirls\
And the sheets they're lookin' out for better weather\
Omkvæd\

And it's all for me grog\
Me jolly, jolly grog\
All for my beer and tobacco\
Well, I spent all me tin\
With the ladies drinkin' gin\
Far across the Western Ocean I must wander\

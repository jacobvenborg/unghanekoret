Doe, a deer, a female deer<br>
Ray, a drop of golden sun<br>
Me, a name I call myself<br>
Far, a long, long way to run<br>
Sow, a needle pulling thread<br>
La, a note to follow so<br>
Tea, I drink with jam and bread<br>
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh<br>

Re, a drop of golden sun<br>
Mi, a name I call myself<br>
Fa, a long, long way to run<br>
So, a needle pulling thread<br>
La, a note to follow so<br>
Ti, I drink with jam and bread<br>
That will bring us back to Do, oh oh oh<br>

A-stykke<br>
Imagine me and you, I do<br>
I think about you day and night<br>
It's only right<br>
To think about the girl you love<br>
And hold her tight<br>
So happy together<br>

A-stykke<br>
If I should call you up, invest a dime<br>
And you say you belong to me<br>
And ease my mind<br>
Imagine how the world could be<br>
So very fine<br>
So happy together<br>

B-stykke<br>
I can't see me loving nobody but you for all my life<br>
When you're with me, baby, the skies will be blue for all my life<br>

A-stykke<br>
Me and you and you and me<br>
No matter how they tossed the dice<br>
It had to be<br>
The only one for me is you<br>
And you for me<br>
So happy together<br>

No matter how they tossed the dice<br>
It had to be<br>

And you for me<br>

How is the weather?<br>

We're happy together<br>

We're happy together<br>

So happy together<br>
So happy together<br>

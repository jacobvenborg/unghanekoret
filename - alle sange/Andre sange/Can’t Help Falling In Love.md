Wise men say<br>
Only fools rush in<br>
But I can't help falling in love with you<br>
Shall I stay?<br>
Would it be a sin<br>
If I can't help falling in love with you?<br>

Like a river flows<br>
Surely to the sea<br>
Darling, so it goes<br>
Some things are meant to be<br>

Take my hand,<br>
Take my whole life, too<br>
For I can't help falling in love with you<br>

For I can't help falling in love with you<br>

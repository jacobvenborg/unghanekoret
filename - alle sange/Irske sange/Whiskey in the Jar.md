1.<br>
As I was a goin' over the far famed Kerry mountains<br>
I met with captain Farrell and his money he was counting<br>
I first produced me pistol and then produced me rapier<br>
Saying "Stand and deliver" for he were a foul deceiver<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny<br>
I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny<br>
She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me<br>
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber<br>
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder<br>
But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water<br>
Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

'Twas early in the morning, just before I rose to travel<br>
Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell<br>
I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier<br>
I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

Now some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'<br>
and others take delight in the hurling and the bowling<br>
but I take delight in the juice of the barley<br>
and courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army<br>
If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney<br>
And if he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny<br>
And I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny<br>

Omkvæd<br>
Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da<br>
Whack for my daddy-o.<br>
Whack for my daddy-o<br>
There's whiskey in the jar<br>

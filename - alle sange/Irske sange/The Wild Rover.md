1.<br>
I've been a wild rover for many's a year,<br>
And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer<br>
And now I'm returning with gold in great store,<br>
And I never will play the wild rover no more<br>

Omkvæd<br>
And it's no, nay, never<br>
No, nay, never, no more<br>
Will I play the wild rover<br>
No, never, no more<br>

2.<br>
I went to an ale-house I used to frequent,<br>
And I told the landlady my money was spent<br>
I asked her for credit, she answered me "nay,<br>
Such a custom like yours I can have any day"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
And it's no, nay, never<br>
No, nay, never, no more<br>
Will I play the wild rover<br>
No, never, no more<br>

3.<br>
I took from my pocket ten sovereigns bright,<br>
And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight<br>
She said "I have whiskeys and wines of the best,<br>
And the words that I told you were only in jest"<br>

Omkvæd<br>
And it's no, nay, never<br>
No, nay, never, no more<br>
Will I play the wild rover<br>
No, never, no more<br>

4.<br>
I'll go home to my parents, confess what I've done,<br>
And I'll ask them to pardon their prodigal son<br>
And when they’ve caressed me as oft’ times before,<br>
Then I never will play the wild rover no more<br>

Omkvæd<br>
And it's no, nay, never<br>
No, nay, never, no more<br>
Will I play the wild rover<br>
No, never, no more<br>

1.<br>
I took a stroll on the old long walk<br>
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay<br>
I met a little girl and we stopped to talk<br>
Of a fine soft day -I-ay<br>

Omkvæd x 2<br>
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do<br>
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue<br>
And I knew right then I'd be takin' a whirl<br>
'Round the Salthill Prom with a Galway girl<br>

2.<br>
We were halfway there when the rain came down<br>
Of a day -I-ay-I-ay<br>
And she asked me up to her flat downtown<br>
Of a fine soft day -I-ay<br>

Omkvæd x 2<br>
And I ask you, friend, what's a fella to do<br>
'Cause her hair was black and her eyes were blue<br>
So I took her hand and I gave her a twirl<br>
And I lost my heart to a Galway girl<br>

3.<br>
When I woke up I was all alone<br>
-- -- --<br>
With a broken heart and a ticket home<br>
-- -- --<br>

Omkvæd<br>
And I ask you now, tell me what would you do<br>
If her hair was black and her eyes were blue<br>
I've traveled around been all over this world<br>
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl<br>
I've never seen nothin' like a Galway girl<br>
